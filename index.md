				I’ve spent a long time working with business partners across the healthcare, credit card, payroll, and commodities trading spaces implementing technology solutions that drive business outcomes.  During these projects, I’ve had the privilege to work with a lot of high-performing and multidisciplinary teams and have seen how they succeed and fail.  I love how the cloud has changed the way we work and am excited to see what amazing new technology the future brings.

				I'm planning on writing mostly about Azure but reserve the right to post pictures of things that my dog has chewed up or parts of my house that have been “illustrated” by my children or wherever my current interest land.&nbsp; Any content suggestions can be logged as an issue in this [Github repo](https://github.com/grayjeremy/contosolife.com), I’m thinking about lasers, Azure, 3d printing, strange things to buy off eBay, whatever.

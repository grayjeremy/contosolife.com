            Hopefully, I’ll get some content on here soon that consists of more than pictures of things that my dog has chewed up or parts of my house that have been “illustrated” by my children.&nbsp; Any content suggestions can go into the comments, I’m thinking about lasers, Azure, 3d printing, strange things to buy off eBay, whatever.<br><br>

            add a blurb about me here, maybe talk about blog and speaking<br>
            More stuff here
